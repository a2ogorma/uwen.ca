last summer, when America announced its </span><span lang="EN-US"><a href="https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2017/08/273050.htm"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;color:#1155CC">intention to withdraw

country, the world, and the integrity of the agreement itself. Largely
unaddressed in this discussion was the impact of various mechanisms that are
created as a result of agreements such as this one and other forms of </span><span lang="EN-US"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_law"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;color:#1155CC">soft </span></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_law"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:107%;color:#1155CC">law</span></a></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%">. While many hard laws can often
create further issues, division and resistance to implementation, soft law is a
necessary tool to facilitate the transition towards more sustainable energy
sources.</span></p>

Climate Change</span></h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%">One
way to accomplish this is to use soft law to develop a high-level framework for
tackling large scale issues. While more enforceable, harder laws are intended
to enforce compliance, there are often unintended side effects that arise as a
result of backlash against them, particularly when handled incorrectly. Notably,
a previous effort to combat climate change, the Kyoto Protocol of 1995, had </span><span lang="EN-US"><a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2011/12/29/was-the-kyoto-protocol-a-success-or-failure/"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;color:#1155CC">mixed success</span></a></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%">. It had attempted to be
hard law, creating mandatory, binding targets for emissions. This is difficult
to enforce on an international level, and economic concerns of key countries greatly
lessened the intended effects of the agreement.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%">Soft
law, on the other hand, is merely designed to inform what intended action
should be, acting as a normative guideline to encourage desired behavior. To
achieve a reduction in the rate of global warming, the Paris Agreement was
designed to target carbon emissions, </span><span lang="EN-US"><a href="http://unfccc.int/files/bodies/cop/application/pdf/overview_1cp21_tasks_.pdf"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;color:#1155CC">from mitigation
strategies to financial assistance</span></a></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%">. This in turn prompted discussion of
a carbon budget, with specific action items to be discussed within each member
state.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%">The
solution created and implemented for the current agreement was in the form of
intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs), where countries
voluntarily determined their contribution to reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.
The guidelines outlined by the Paris Agreement formed a proper framework to combat
emissions, changing the focus to INDCs from global emissions targets. As of February
2018, </span><span lang="EN-US"><a href="http://unfccc.int/paris_agreement/items/9444.php"><span style="font-size:

plan at the national level, such as the </span><span lang="EN-US"><a href="https://pm.gc.ca/eng/news/2016/12/09/communique-canadas-first-ministers"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;color:#1155CC">Pan-Canadian Framework

objectives, these plans will have to propagate through all levels of government
in order to have long term impacts.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%">As
opposed to companies simply reacting to hard law, the anticipation of future legislation
as a result of initial soft law can often be a driving force for emissions
reduction, within the energy industry in particular. Gradual changes in
legislation are causing industry to more carefully plan and organize for the
longer term, anticipating further policy and societal changes that will affect
their bottom line. Larger societal changes such as sustainability, becoming
more prevalent and codified in legislation, is having an effect on industry
stakeholders. The oil and gas industry in particular is in the process of a
transition towards greater sustainability, as can be seen by </span><span lang="EN-US"><a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/shell-seeks-greener-path-amid-lower-forever-oil-prices"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;color:#1155CC">Royal Dutch Shell CEO</span></a><a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/shell-seeks-greener-path-amid-lower-forever-oil-prices"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;color:#1155CC"> Ben Van Beurden

carbon tax</span></a></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:107%">. While a variety of factors may be affecting these stances,
soft law concerning carbon taxes in many nations (such as the Pan-Canadian
Framework, mentioned earlier) certainly enabled and furthered this discussion.
As increasingly tougher regulation and emissions controls will ultimately
affect large corporations’ profits, it becomes imperative for them to
reorganize their resources in preparation of this change, so as to ensure
optimal returns to shareholders. Changes to soft law, and the likely further
policy changes they represent, are a large contributing factor to changes in
the energy industry.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%">While
not having the same authoritative power as compared to hard law, soft law also
has an increasingly large influence on the very public notion of </span><span lang="EN-US"><a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corp-social-responsibility.asp"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;color:#1155CC">corporate social
responsibility</span></a></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:107%">. In short, this is the relationship between organizations
and the public, and how a company’s actions are perceived in the context of the
greater society, or its shareholders. It is typically a reflection of the
general public, and usually, soft law often determines what is socially
acceptable for businesses. Shareholders at many companies such as </span><span lang="EN-US"><a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/article/exxon-suffers-stinging-defeat-on-shareholder-climate-resolution-cm797244"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;color:#1155CC">Exxon</span></a></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%"> and </span><span lang="EN-US"><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/may/21/rebellious-shell-shareholders-to-vote-for-new-climate-change-goals"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;color:#1155CC">Shell</span></a></span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%"> have been pushing for

<h3><a name="_6av9eett2b15"></a><span lang="EN-US">What can we take from this?</span></h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%">For
industry, it is clear that long term thinking is critical for any business. The
increasingly uncertain energy and regulatory landscape will require greater
transparency and proper corporate governance to reduce emissions and provide
long-term profit for shareholders. If these soft laws are any indicator, people
and the planet are quickly becoming just as important as profit. In order to
survive, major industry players must have as a core focus the development of
more sustainable technologies and practices.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><a name="_jksibxw2ps46"></a><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%">Investors and the general public have
a role to play too. Pushing for climate action from governments and industry
alike will be instrumental to increased transparency on these issues. The
energy industry is uniquely positioned to provide leadership on emissions
reduction practices and climate action, and as seen, soft law is necessary to
ensure that long-term sustainability goals within this industry are realized.</span></p>
