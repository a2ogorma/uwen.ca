<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b>The University of
Waterloo needs an Energy Engineering Program</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I'll preface this article by saying that I am in no way an
energy expert- I'm somewhat new to the energy community and while I have gained
lots of knowledge and met some interesting people from the position I've been
in since last semester, I'm always wanting to know more and broaden my horizons
within renewable and alternative energy solutions. My problem is, how exactly
does one go about this? I could watch countless youtube videos and read
Wikipedia for days, but beyond an over-arching grasp of some abstract concepts
(which is still useful), I don't think students have many opportunities to
learn and gain hands-on skills when it comes to renewable energy development or
energy research here at the University of Waterloo. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Firstly, to address the resources we do have: If you
haven't checked out these organizations or groups at Waterloo and are
interested you should! To give full credit, the University does have a Master
of Engineering in Green Energy program, which has benefitted its students
greatly and is pushing a great initiative of attempting to expediate foreign
students into the Canadian workforce in a field that will benefit their
country. I, however, will be focusing on undergraduate programs graduating
large numbers of students with broad knowledge ready to enter the workforce or
pursue further education. The Waterloo Institute for Sustainable Energy<sup>1</sup>
is a great resource for students interested in energy research, for starters; I
think this is also a great example of the disconnect between the students and
faculty when it comes to the energy industry. WISE produces some great
research, and while they have public events and are more than accessible when
reached out to, they're very much that: a research institute. It is somewhat of
a niche community, and as much as we and the WISE team members are trying to
connect students with them, it seems that the campus is relatively unaware of
WISE or sees it as a faculty-only organization. 'By contrast, other niche
research initiatives (I'm going to be biased and use my program to speak from
experience) are much closer to the ground and connected to the students through
their programs, such as the Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology and all its
associated professors. A program directly related to it initiates students to
try out their interests, helps with the development of related skills, and
brings in even more researchers and thus student opportunities. A research
initiative without active student influence involvement leaves room for
improvement at an academic institution. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The energy industry in its current state is undergoing
one of the biggest revolutions of a major economic sector in recent years. The
major companies are starting to realize that renewables are being demanded by
the public and won't go away, with collectives in the automotive industry
developing electric, Tesla driving the market, and oil companies like Shell and
BP<sup>2</sup> starting to diversify out of just traditional energy sources.
Growing concerns about traditional energy, notably public health and climate
change, are causing major push from the public to increase the use of
renewables, which is why startups have a very attractive place to put
themselves at the moment. Citizens in North America overwhelmingly support
renewable energy initiatives<sup>3</sup>, which will drive big money to these
projects for positive marketing and demand as long as the technology is there.
The market is primed and booming for startups, for example micro and nanogrid
energy providers, renewable energy innovators, and analytical software
companies to take control and hack away from the traditional share of the
energy sector and drive change. This is happening for sure, and there are some
majorly successful startups and up-and-comers who are going to do great things
in energy.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>'My problem in this is our involvement. A large part of
the University of Waterloo's identity is our entrepreneurial spirit and
start-up culture. Unfortunately, there are only a handful of companies coming
from our velocity centre involved in the energy market (Salient Energy,
EnPowered, Borealis Wind, and arguably H2nanO), and while these are companies
doing great things, this only accounts for 4 of the 160+ companies to
successfully come out of the Velocity incubator. The argument could be made
that these numbers are skewed by software startups as these are much easier and
lower cost/stake to take to a developed, marketable product, however the energy
numbers pale in comparison to other 'niche' and/or difficult to bring to market
sectors such as nanotechnology(15<sup>4</sup>) or biology(10<sup>5</sup>) which
have their own programs. To once again compare to nanotech, this level of
startup engagement is obviously coming from the fact that a program specific to
this industry exists. To play our own horn for a second, The University of
Waterloo has shown itself to be one of the most dominant and leading sources of
innovation in the country and we need to pick up the pace when it comes to
energy. To look at an example sample: The Bloomberg New Energy Finance picks
ten startups<sup>6</sup> every year from the energy sector. Looking through the
selections from 2017 and 2016, every company was USA, Europe, or Africa based.
Startup Energy Transition, another Energy startup award organization, awarded
startups from France, Germany, India, Bangladesh, and Nigeria in 2017.' The
ATCE awarded 3 energy startups from the US. Evidently Canada is not producing
startups that are as competitive as these countries at the same volume in
today's market. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Energy, renewable generation, and the environment are all
topics that I believe students, and specifically students at this campus,
genuinely are passionate about. The University of Waterloo has done an amazing
job creating undergraduate programs in areas that other Universities haven't
but at this point an energy program is badly overdue. University of Calgary,
University of Toronto, Carleton University, and other top and innovative
institutions are creating degrees in this space and I strongly believe that the
interest, market space, and resources would easily be filled by students
wanting to occupy a space in this field.</p>
