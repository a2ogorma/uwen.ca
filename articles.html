					<p>Earlier last summer, when America announced its intention to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, many tried to rationalize what it meant for their country, the world, and the integrity of the agreement itself. Largely unaddressed in this discussion was the impact of various mechanisms that are created as a result of agreements such as this one and other forms of soft law. While many hard laws can often create further issues, division and resistance to implementation, soft law is a necessary tool to facilitate the transition towards more sustainable energy sources.</p>
					<h3>Framework Convention on Climate Change</h3>
					<p>One way to accomplish this is to use soft law to develop a high-level framework for tackling large scale issues. While more enforceable, harder laws are intended to enforce compliance, there are often unintended side effects that arise as a result of backlash against them, particularly when handled incorrectly. Notably, a previous effort to combat climate change, the Kyoto Protocol of 1995, had mixed success. It had attempted to be hard law, creating mandatory, binding targets for emissions. This is difficult to enforce on an international level, and economic concerns of key countries greatly lessened the intended effects of the agreement.</p>
					<p>Soft law, on the other hand, is merely designed to inform what intended action should be, acting as a normative guideline to encourage desired behavior. To achieve a reduction in the rate of global warming, the Paris Agreement was designed to target carbon emissions, from mitigation strategies to financial assistance. This in turn prompted discussion of a carbon budget, with specific action items to be discussed within each member state.</p>
					<p>The solution created and implemented for the current agreement was in the form of intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs), where countries voluntarily determined their contribution to reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The guidelines outlined by the Paris Agreement formed a proper framework to combat emissions, changing the focus to INDCs from global emissions targets. As of February 2018, 174 of the 195 initial signatories have ratified the agreement. The INDCs formed as a result are the basis of an action plan at the national level, such as the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change from December 2016. To fulfil these objectives, these plans will have to propagate through all levels of government in order to have long term impacts.</p>
					<h3>Corporate Sustainability</h3>
					<p>As opposed to companies simply reacting to hard law, the anticipation of future legislation as a result of initial soft law can often be a driving force for emissions reduction, within the energy industry in particular. Gradual changes in legislation are causing industry to more carefully plan and organize for the longer term, anticipating further policy and societal changes that will affect their bottom line. Larger societal changes such as sustainability, becoming more prevalent and codified in legislation, is having an effect on industry stakeholders. The oil and gas industry in particular is in the process of a transition towards greater sustainability, as can be seen by Royal Dutch Shell CEO Ben Van Beurden bracing for ‘lower forever oil’ and investing in renewable energies, Shell being among related companies supporting a carbon tax. While a variety of factors may be affecting these stances, soft law concerning carbon taxes in many nations (such as the Pan-Canadian Framework, mentioned earlier) certainly enabled and furthered this discussion. As increasingly tougher regulation and emissions controls will ultimately affect large corporations’ profits, it becomes imperative for them to reorganize their resources in preparation of this change, so as to ensure optimal returns to shareholders. Changes to soft law, and the likely further policy changes they represent, are a large contributing factor to changes in the energy industry.</p>
					<p>While not having the same authoritative power as compared to hard law, soft law also has an increasingly large influence on the very public notion of corporate social responsibility. In short, this is the relationship between organizations and the public, and how a company’s actions are perceived in the context of the greater society, or its shareholders. It is typically a reflection of the general public, and usually, soft law often determines what is socially acceptable for businesses. Shareholders at many companies such as Exxon and Shell have been pushing for greater transparency surrounding climate change since the Paris Agreement, and if recent trends are any indicator, this is likely to continue.</p>
					<h3>What can we take from this?</h3>
					<p>For industry, it is clear that long term thinking is critical for any business. The increasingly uncertain energy and regulatory landscape will require greater transparency and proper corporate governance to reduce emissions and provide long-term profit for shareholders. If these soft laws are any indicator, people and the planet are quickly becoming just as important as profit. In order to survive, major industry players must have as a core focus the development of more sustainable technologies and practices.</p>
					<p>Investors and the general public have a role to play too. Pushing for climate action from governments and industry alike will be instrumental to increased transparency on these issues. The energy industry is uniquely positioned to provide leadership on emissions reduction practices and climate action, and as seen, soft law is necessary to ensure that long-term sustainability goals within this industry are realized.</p>
